# TPF2-Timetables
## Project setup
The project is split into 3 parts, represented by 3 different script files.
### Timetable Logic
All the timetable logic is implemented in ```/res/scripts/celmi/timetables/timetable.lua```
The timetable is stored in a giant LUA table. See wiki for further documentation. [Link](https://github.com/IncredibleHannes/TPF2-Timetables/wiki/Timetable-object)   
The timetable module provides all necessary methods to alter the timetable and to request its information.
It is read-only to the engine thread and read/write to the GUI thread.
### UI Logic
The UI logic is implemented in ```/res/config/game_script/timetable_gui.lua```
It creates all necessary menus and holds an instance of the timetable, to modify it accordingly to the user inputs.
It also oversees checking if a vehicle requires stopping due to the timetable.
### Game API requests
All game API requests are summarized in ```res/scripts/celmi/timetables/timetable_helper.lua```.
This module provides useful util functions and does all Game API calls that are necessary to get the current state of the game.
